Description of Variables
========================

For the final data set, there were 42 variables:

1: Subject - 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Numbered between 1 and 30.
2: Activity - Six activities: (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
3 - 8: 
movement_of_body_MEAN_on_X_axis_of_phone

acc_due_to_gravity_STD_on_Z_axis_of_phone
- These variables give the mean and standard deviation on the XYZ axes of the phone as determined by the acceleration due to gravity. This data has been normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

15 - 20:    
jerk_of_body_MEAN_on_X_axis_of_phone
jerk_of_body_MEAN_on_Y_axis_of_phone

jerk_of_body_STD_on_X_axis_of_phone
jerk_of_body_STD_on_Y_axis_of_phone
jerk_of_body_STD_on_Z_axis_of_phone
- These variables give the mean and standard deviation on the XYZ axes of the phone as determined by the linear acceleration, or jerks, of the body. This data has been normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

21 - 26
rotation_of_body_MEAN_on_X_axis_of_phone
rotation_of_body_MEAN_on_Y_axis_of_phone
rotation_of_body_MEAN_on_Z_axis_of_phone
rotation_of_body_STD_on_X_axis_of_phone
rotation_of_body_STD_on_Y_axis_of_phone
rotation_of_body_STD_on_Z_axis_of_phone
- These variables give the mean and standard deviation on the XYZ axes of the phone as determined by the rotations of the body. This data has been normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

27 - 32    
jerk_rotation_of_body_MEAN_on_X_axis_of_phone

jerk_rotation_of_body_STD_on_X_axis_of_phone
jerk_rotation_of_body_STD_on_Y_axis_of_phone
jerk_rotation_of_body_STD_on_Z_axis_of_phone
- These variables give the mean and standard deviation on the XYZ axes of the phone as determined by the angular velocity, or jerk rotations, of the body. This data has been normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

33 - 34:
total_movement_of_body_MEAN
total_movement_of_body_STD
- These variables give the total mean and standard deviation of the phone on all axes as determined by the movement of the body. This data has been normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

35 - 36:                   
total_acc_due_to_gravity_MEAN

37 - 38:
total_jerk_of_body_MEAN
total_jerk_of_body_STD                       
- These variables give the total mean and standard deviation of the phone on all axes as determined by the linear acceleration, or jerks, of the body. This data has been normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

39 - 40:
